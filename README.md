# CIS-221-Analytics-Application
This repository contains the projects I completed for my Analytics Application course. Each mini-project showcases my skills in business analytics, including data analysis, interpretation, and the application of analytical techniques to real-world scenarios.
# 3.1 — Challenges I Experienced in EDA, Inferential Regression, and ML Regression
Throughout the course, I encountered several challenges while working on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Inferential Regression, and Regression for Machine Learning. One of the main difficulties was interpreting results in context. While I could generate descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, and regression outputs correctly, translating these outputs into actionable insights or connecting them to real-world business scenarios was often challenging.
In inferential regression, I sometimes struggled with understanding concepts such as p-values, confidence intervals, statistical significance, and assumptions of normality. Computing these metrics was manageable, but interpreting their meaning and implications for decision-making took significant effort. 
Regression for machine learning posed additional challenges due to its complexity. The workflow was less straightforward than traditional regression, and I found model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating performance metrics particularly overwhelming. The experimental and iterative nature of ML made it difficult at times to feel confident in the results or know the “next step” to take.
# 3.2 — Reasons Behind These Challenges and Lessons Learned
Several factors contributed to these challenges. First, learning to code while applying statistical reasoning imposes a high cognitive load. According to cognitive load theory, when multiple new skills are being learned simultaneously, it can overwhelm working memory. In this course, I needed to understand programming syntax, run code, interpret outputs, and apply analytical reasoning all at once, which sometimes felt mentally exhausting.
Second, statistical concepts build on one another, so gaps in foundational knowledge can make advanced topics like regression coefficients, multicollinearity, or model diagnostics difficult to grasp. Third, machine learning introduces experimentation and abstraction, which can feel unpredictable. Unlike standard regression, ML requires trial-and-error, critical evaluation, and tuning, which was initially intimidating.

Despite these challenges, I learned several valuable lessons:

* Revisiting notes and reflecting on outputs improves understanding and reinforces learning.
* Documentation, experimentation, and validating assumptions are critical to building confidence and accuracy.
* Analysis is not just about generating numbers—it’s about interpreting and telling the story behind the data.
* Challenges are part of the learning process; each difficulty strengthens analytical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

# 3.3 — Steps to Improve Next Time
To continue improving my skills, I plan to:
* Strengthen foundational knowledge in statistics, probability, and regression to make advanced concepts more intuitive.
* Focus on interpretation as much as computation—always asking “why” the results matter and what they imply for decision-making.
* Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps to reduce cognitive overload and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
* Practice coding regularly, even through small exercises, to improve fluency, confidence, and familiarity with syntax.
* Explore additional learning resources such as tutorials, documentation, and visualization tools to deepen understanding.
Overall, this course taught me that progress in data analytics and machine learning comes from patience, consistent practice, and reflection. Each challenge I encountered has strengthened my skills, and I feel more confident approaching complex datasets and regression problems with a structured and thoughtful mindset.
